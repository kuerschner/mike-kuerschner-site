                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I am a motivated and highly data-driven individual that thrives in a fast-paced, collaborative environment. I have a strong affinity towards technology, music, and the outdoors. When I’m not hiking or camping with my wife and three dogs, you can find me online researching new skills, taking courses, or working on my music. From a young age, I found that anything is possible if you take a strong interest and seek out as many opportunities to learn as possible. It started with learning the bass guitar when there was already a drummer for the band, then moved on to artist management and front end web design when the band needed concerts and a website. Recently, I’ve dove head-first into React development and have been working in that space for two years. I’ve always loved roles and opportunities that combine my creative personality with my strong analytical skills.</p>
